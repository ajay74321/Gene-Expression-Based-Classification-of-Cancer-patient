# Gene-Expression-Based-Classification-of-Cancer-patient

## ðŸ§¬ Introduction
Cancer is marked by uncontrolled cell growth and progression through stages. Early detection and accurate stage classification are crucial for guiding treatment and improving outcomes.
This project develops machine learning models to classify cancer patients into early (+1) or late (â€“1) stage using ~60,000 gene expression features. Due to the high dimensionality, preprocessing and feature selection are essential to avoid overfitting.The workflow integrates statistical analysis, dimensionality reduction, and classifiers such as PCA, SVM, and AutoML to uncover patterns in gene expression data. This demonstrates how computational biology and machine learning can advance cancer diagnostics and support clinical decision-making.
